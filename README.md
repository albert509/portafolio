## 👨🏽‍💻 Hi, Im Luis Alberto
>Im a Fullstack web developer from the Dominican Republic with experience in Asp.net and Vuejs.

>I love the web and all the technology around it for its flexibility and how easy it makes sharing my work and experiment with others.

### 🗺 My web dev journey
>I started my web developer journey more that 4 years ago with Asp.net MVC and I loved the razor syntax at the moment.
>
>But quickly I realize that in order to achieve that desktop app feeling I had to find an alternative that let my users interact without the need to reload the whole page whenever they clicked a button, thats when I found Vuejs.
>
>So I have been doing my apis in **Asp.net core** and my frontEnd in **Vuejs** ever since 💁🏽‍♂️.
